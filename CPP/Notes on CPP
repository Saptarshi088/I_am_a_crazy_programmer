vector.size() - tells the size of the vector.
vector.begin() - Tells the position of the iterator that is at the begining.
vector.end() - tells the position of the iterator that is at the end of the Vector.
vector.size() - Tells the Maximum Size of the Vector.
vector.at(i) - displays the data that is at the ith position of the Vector.
vector.insert(position, Value) - Inserts the value to the positon. 
vector<data-type> :: iterator iter = vector.begin() - Iterator for the insert() operator.
